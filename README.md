# Pawns-Only-Chess is a project from the Jetbrains Academy Kotlin basick track. It represents two players and a chess board. The only figures in the game are pawns.
The game is done either when one of the figures reaches the last row or when one of the players looses all of his pawns. The game allows for the pawns to use all 
movements of the chess game: move one cell at a time (or two if it is its first move), capture enemy pawn or en passant. Also if the game is still ongoing and there
is not any possible move, the program will automatically declare stalemate and finish the game.
